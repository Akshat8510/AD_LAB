Welcome to **AD_LAB**! This repository serves as a digital lab notebook where I record my progress in **Application Development**, specifically focusing on the intersection of data-driven applications and preprocessing techniques.

## 📖 The Story Behind the Code
I don't just write code; I document the "Why" and the "How." For every major task or tutorial found in this repository, I write a detailed, beginner-friendly article on **Medium** to help others navigate the same challenges I faced.
